          <p><em>I Just Can't Help Myself</em> is about the sometimes inexplicable impulse to draw outside the lines, or in this case: shake antique vases and touch paintings in a classic art museum. The observer is invited to embrace the urge and become the artist, revealing their own version of an existing painting as their exploration of the environment deepens, toying with the notion that misbehaving is a creative act of self discovery.

            <br><br>
            The concept for <em>I Just Can’t Help Myself</em> came about as a marriage of many interests and a desire to create something that might spark joy in a year with so little. At its core, the piece is about letting yourself imagine something kind of silly and absurd, knowing that every time you push those boundaries you find out a little more of yourself and the world in the process. And furthering the concept, there is an element of physically manifesting the role of the observer in art - allowing them to literally change a work of art based on how they experience the environment.
            <br><br>
            I experimented with projecting manipulations of the painting with various p5.js sketches, but found that the most interesting effect was created in deepening the OSC control capabilities in MadMapper. Some of the most interesting effects Matt and I created in the video were from programming accidents, such as having one touch response control multiple elements, that I opted to keep. I followed my intuition to discover the concept as I created things that felt right to create - I only knew I wanted my painting to be unassuming and mildly boring, but the idea for the vases came to me spontaneously after finding a stash of old clear flower vases that I found myself spray painting late one night. All objects involved needed to be finished with conductive materials, which I intentionally disguised as ornate features. So by accident, the making of the piece describes its finished product: partially planned, partially improvised and bending the all rules involved.
            <br><br>
            The most exciting moment creating this piece was realizing that it had things to show me once everything was connected at once. I wasn’t expecting to have another participant who had no prior knowledge for how the objects were programmed for filming that day, but Matt Chacon from Gray Area was around and ended up being a priceless addition. Our spontaneous collaboration added a whole new surprise dimension and actually made the piece more fun for each of us, an aspect of which I’ve been thinking about ever since.
