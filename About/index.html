            #ersatzGirl is photographic alchemy. In it, she layers hundreds of photographs
            over themselves to create hyper-realities - blurring the lines between photograph and painting and
            intentionally choosing Instagram as the gallery, in a commentary of social media's surreal tangential reality
            to our lives.

            <a class="links" href="https://emilyinamillion.me/i-just-cant-help-myself/"><i>I Just Can't Help Myself</i></a> is about the sometimes inexplicable impulse to draw outside the lines, or in this case: shake antique vases and touch paintings in a classic art museum. The observer is invited to embrace the urge and become the artist, revealing their own version of an existing painting as their exploration of the environment deepens, toying with the notion that misbehaving is a creative act of self discovery.
